Notes
-----
    You may not use cv2.pyrUp or cv2.pyrDown anywhere in this assignment.

GENERAL RULES:
    1. DO NOT INCLUDE code that saves, shows, displays, writes the image that
    you are being passed in. Do that on your own if you need to save the images
    but these functions should NOT save the image to disk.

    2. DO NOT import any other libraries aside from those that we provide.
    You should be able to complete the assignment with the given libraries
    (and in many cases without them).

    3. DO NOT change the format of this file. You may NOT change function
    type signatures (not even named parameters with defaults). You may add
    additional code to this file at your discretion, however it is your
    responsibility to ensure that the autograder accepts your submission.

    4. This file has only been tested in the course virtual environment.
    You are responsible for ensuring that your code executes properly in the
    virtual machine environment, and that any changes you make outside the
    areas annotated for student code do not impact your performance on the
    autograder system.

    region (i.e., the convolution operation should return an image of the same
    shape as the input) for the convolution. Subsampling must include the first
    row and column, skip the second, etc.

    Example (assuming 3-tap filter and 1-pixel padding; 5-tap is analogous):

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : numpy.ndarray

def expand_layer(image, kernel=generatingKernel(0.4)):
    """Upsample the image to double the row and column dimensions, and then
    convolve it with a generating kernel.

    Upsampling the image means that every other row and every other column will
    have a value of zero (which is why we apply the convolution after). For
    grading purposes, it is important that you use a reflected border (i.e.,
    padding equivalent to cv2.BORDER_REFLECT101) and only keep the valid region
    (i.e., the convolution operation should return an image of the same
    shape as the input) for the convolution.

    Finally, multiply your output image by a factor of 4 in order to scale it
    back up. If you do not do this (and you should try it out without that)
    you will see that your images darken as you apply the convolution.
    You must explain why this happens in your submission PDF.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : numpy.ndarray
        An image of dimension (r, c).

    levels : int
        A positive integer that specifies the number of reductions to perform.
        For example, levels=0 should return a list containing just the input
        image; levels = 1 should perform one reduction and return a list with
        two images. In general, len(output) = levels + 1.

    Returns
    -------
    list<numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float)>
        A list of arrays of dtype np.float. The first element of the list

def laplPyramid(gaussPyr):

    pyramid will have the same number of levels as the input.

    You must use your expand_layer() function to generate the pyramid. The
    Gaussian Pyramid that is passed in is the output of your gaussPyramid
    function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gaussPyr : list<numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float)>
        A Gaussian Pyramid (as returned by your gaussPyramid function), which
        is a list of numpy.ndarray items.

    Returns
    -------
    list<numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float)>
        A laplacian pyramid of the same size as gaussPyr. This pyramid should
        be represented in the same way as guassPyr, as a list of arrays. Every
        element of the list now corresponds to a layer of the laplacian
        pyramid, containing the difference between two layers of the gaussian
        pyramid.

        NOTE: The last element of output should be identical to the last layer
              of the input pyramid since it cannot be subtracted anymore.

    Notes
    -----
        (1) Sometimes the size of the expanded image will be larger than the
        given layer. You should crop the expanded image to match in shape with
        the given layer. If you do not do this, you will get a 'ValueError:
        operands could not be broadcast together' because you can't subtract
        differently sized matrices.

        For example, if my layer is of size 5x7, reducing and expanding will
        result in an image of size 6x8. In this case, crop the expanded layer
        to 5x7.

    You should return a laplacian pyramid that is of the same dimensions as the
    input pyramids. Every layer should be an alpha blend of the corresponding
    layers of the input pyramids, weighted by the gaussian mask.

    Therefore, pixels where current_mask == 1 should be taken completely from
    the white image, and pixels where current_mask == 0 should be taken
    completely from the black image.

    (The variables `current_mask`, `white_image`, and `black_image` refer to
    the images from each layer of the pyramids. This computation must be
    performed for every layer of the pyramid.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    laplPyrWhite : list<numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float)>
        A laplacian pyramid of an image constructed by your laplPyramid
        function.

    laplPyrBlack : list<numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float)>
        A laplacian pyramid of another image constructed by your laplPyramid
        function.

    gaussPyrMask : list<numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float)>
        A gaussian pyramid of the mask. Each value should be in the range

    add it to the second to smallest layer. Then, expand the second to
    smallest layer, and continue the process until you are at the largest
    image. This is your result.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pyramid : list<numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float)>
        A list of numpy.ndarray images. You can assume the input is taken

    Notes
    -----
        (1) Sometimes expand will return an image that is larger than the next
        layer. In this case, you should crop the expanded image down to the
        size of the next layer. Look into numpy slicing to do this easily.

        For example, expanding a layer of size 3x4 will result in an image of
        size 6x8. If the next layer is of size 5x7, crop the expanded image
        to size 5x7.
